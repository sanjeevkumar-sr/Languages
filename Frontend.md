ðŸ’» What Is Frontend in Software Development?
Frontend refers to everything the user sees and interacts with â€” buttons, forms, text, images, animations, menus, layouts, etc. Itâ€™s the UI (User Interface) side of apps and websites.

To build frontends, developers use languages and frameworks that turn design into functional, interactive applications.

Angular â€“ fully written in TypeScript

React + TypeScript â€“ combo used in big apps

Next.js â€“ used for server-side React apps with TypeScript support

Type of apps: Scalable and large frontend apps, corporate dashboards, multi-user web apps.

ðŸ”· 5. Dart

Used in: Mainly used with Flutter to build frontend for mobile, web, and desktop apps â€” all from one codebase.

Popular Framework:

Flutter â€“ used for Android, iOS, web, and desktop apps with a single Dart codebase

Type of apps: Cross-platform mobile apps, startup MVPs, chat apps, banking apps (e.g., Google Pay uses Flutter)

ðŸ”· 6. Swift (for iOS frontend)
What it does: Used to build native iOS mobile app frontends.
